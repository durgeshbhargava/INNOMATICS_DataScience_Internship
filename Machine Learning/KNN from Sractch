Task - Predict the diamond price.ðŸ’Ž
Write the KNN code from scratch and make it work on the given dataset ?

Step - 1: Load the data
Step - 2: Perform the EDA on the given dataset
Step - 3: Handle Categorical Columns i.e. convert them to numerical representation (TODO - Wisely choose between LabelEncoding and OneHotEncoding)
Step - 4: Normalise the data
Step - 5: Split the data - Test and Train (recommended 75:25 split)
Step - 6: Build KNN Algorithm from scratch and do the predictions for test data. You should not use the sklearn KNN algorithm here. Write the complete code implementation on KNN.
Step - 7: Evaluate your model
Step - 8: Train a model using sklearn KNN Algorithm and compare the results with your scratch implementation

Dos - 
You can use sklearn for standardising and splitting the dataset to train and test
Scratch implementation of sklearnâ€™s KNN fit function
You can use library functions for LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder  
Use Jupyter Notebook to implement your work
